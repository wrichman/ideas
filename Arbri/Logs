??

Some Blockers:

1. 
change the app ui and think from the user’s perspective
figure out the purpose of the request upgrade button
 2.   problem with grant partners?? where do we find the corresponding partners?
what is the role of the referralEmails and anonReferralEmails
what about the grant_writers_profiles? what do they do?
how come in the code we do: grantWriters?.slice(upgrade.fields.id, 5 + upgrade.fields.id) to get the grant writer profile pictures
how do we match grant writers to grants?
3.   should we be allowed to upvote top upgrades to “interested in grants?” (edited)
